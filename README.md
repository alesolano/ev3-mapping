# ev3-mapping
Repository created for the sake of learning. The goal is that the EV3 could create a map of its environment.

### robot kit

The object of this project is a LEGO Mindstorms EV3, using the [EXPLOR3R chassis](http://robotsquare.com/2015/10/06/explor3r-building-instructions/) designed by Laurens Valk.
The code will be implemented in Python, using the [ev3dev operating system](http://www.ev3dev.org/).

But hey, don't get scared! **You don't need to have an EV3 at home to contribute to the project**. The idea is to develop robotics projects where an EV3 is the tester. So, in order to ease the transition between ideas and implementation, we're developing a [quick guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BQL6n_TtwxtuzLo3r-wGgEYh9efFLvU81lJhyMmS0ns/edit?usp=sharing) to program an EV3 with Python.
